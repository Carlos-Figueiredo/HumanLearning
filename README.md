ENEM is Brazil's biggest exam. All students finishing High School take it, either to use it as a certificate of graduation or to apply to enter in brazilians universities.
It's organizing entity, MEC, realeases every year a lot of information regarding the exam.
The idea of this project is to explore this Data.
